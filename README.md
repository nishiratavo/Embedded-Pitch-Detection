# Embedded-Pitch-Detection
Embedded pitch detection in STM32F407G-DISC1 with four techniques :  
Harmonic Product Spectrum (HPS)  
Cepstrum-Biased HPS (CBHPS)  
Maximum Likelihood (ML)  
Weighted Autocorrelation Function (WACF)  
Described in the paper Efficient Pitch Detection Techniques for Interactive Music (https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~pdelac/research/MyPublishedPapers/icmc_2001-pitch_best.pdf).
